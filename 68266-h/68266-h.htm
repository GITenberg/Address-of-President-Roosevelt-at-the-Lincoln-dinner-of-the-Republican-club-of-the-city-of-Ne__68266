<p class="p4 hang"><span class="smcap">Mr. President, and you, my fellow-members
of the Republican Club,
and you, my fellow-guests of the
Republican Club</span>:</p>
</div>

<p>In his second inaugural, in a speech
which will be read as long as the memory
of this nation endures, Abraham Lincoln
closed by saying:</p>

<p>“With malice toward none; with charity
for all; with firmness in the right, as
God gives us to see the right, let us strive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
on to finish the work we are in; * * *
to do all which may achieve and cherish
a just and lasting peace among ourselves,
and with all nations.”</p>

<p>Immediately after his reelection he
had already spoken thus:</p>

<p>“The strife of the election is but human
nature practically applied to the facts of
the case. What has occurred in this case
must ever recur in similar cases. Human
nature will not change. In any future
great national trial, compared with the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of this, we shall have as weak and as
strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as
good. Let us, therefore, study the incidents
of this as philosophy to learn wisdom
from, and none of them as wrongs
to be revenged. * * * May not all
having a common interest reunite in a
common effort to (serve) our common
country? For my own part, I have striven
and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle
in the way. So long as I have been
here I have not willingly planted a thorn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
in any man’s bosom. While I am deeply
sensible to the high compliment of a reelection,
and duly grateful, as I trust, to
Almighty God for having directed my
countrymen to a right conclusion, as I
think, for their own good, it adds nothing
to my satisfaction that any other man may
be disappointed or pained by the result.</p>

<p>“May I ask those who have not differed
with me to join with me in this same spirit
toward those who have?”</p>

<p>This is the spirit in which mighty Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
sought to bind up the nation’s wounds
when its soul was yet seething with fierce
hatreds, with wrath, with rancor, with all
the evil and dreadful passions provoked
by civil war. Surely this is the spirit
which all Americans should show now,
when there is so little excuse for malice or
rancor or hatred, when there is so little of
vital consequence to divide brother from
brother. [Applause.]</p>

<p>Lincoln, himself a man of southern
birth, did not hesitate to appeal to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
sword when he became satisfied that in no
other way could the Union be saved, for
high though he put peace he put righteousness
still higher. [Applause.] He warred
for the Union; he warred to free the slave;
and when he warred he warred in earnest,
for it is a sign of weakness to be half-hearted
when blows must be struck. [Applause.]
But he felt only love, a love as deep as the
tenderness of his great and sad heart, for all
his countrymen alike in the North and in
the South, and he longed above everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
for the day when they should once more
be knit together in the unbreakable bonds
of eternal friendship. [Applause.]</p>

<p>We of to-day, in dealing with all our
fellow-citizens, white or colored, North or
South, should strive to show just the qualities
that Lincoln showed: His steadfastness
in striving after the right, and his infinite
patience and forbearance with those who
saw that right less clearly than he did;
his earnest endeavor to do what was best,
and yet his readiness to accept the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
that was practicable when the ideal best was
unattainable; his unceasing effort to cure
what was evil, coupled with his refusal to
make a bad situation worse by any ill-judged
or ill-timed effort to make it better.</p>

<p>The great civil war in which Lincoln
towered as the loftiest figure left us not
only a reunited country, but a country
which has the proud right to claim as its
own the glory won alike by those who
wore the blue and by those who wore the
gray, by those who followed Grant and by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
those who followed Lee [applause]; for both
fought with equal bravery and with equal
sincerity of conviction, each striving for
the light as it was given him to see the
light; though it is now clear to all that
the triumph of the cause of freedom and
of the Union was essential to the welfare
of mankind. [Applause.] We are now
one people, a people with failings which
we must not blink, but a people with great
qualities in which we have the right to
feel just pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>All good Americans who dwell in the
North must, because they are good Americans,
feel the most earnest friendship for
their fellow-countrymen who dwell in the
South, a friendship all the greater because
it is in the South that we find in its most
acute phase one of the gravest problems
before our people: the problem of so
dealing with the man of one color as to
secure him the rights that no one would
grudge him if he were of another color.
[Applause.] To solve this problem it is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
of course, necessary to educate him to
perform the duties, a failure to perform
which will render him a curse to himself
and to all around him.</p>

<p>Most certainly all clear-sighted and
generous men in the North appreciate the
difficulty and perplexity of this problem,
sympathize with the South in the embarrassment
of conditions for which she is not
alone responsible, feel an honest wish to
help her where help is practicable, and
have the heartiest respect for those brave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
and earnest men of the South who, in the
face of fearful difficulties, are doing all
that men can do for the betterment alike
of white and of black. The attitude of
the North toward the negro is far from
what it should be and there is need that
the North also should act in good faith
upon the principle of giving to each man
what is justly due him, of treating him on
his worth as a man, granting him no
special favors, but denying him no proper
opportunity for labor and the reward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
of labor. [Applause.] But the peculiar
circumstances of the South render the
problem there far greater and far more
acute.</p>

<p>Neither I nor any other man can say
that any given way of approaching that
problem will present in our time even an
approximately perfect solution, but we can
safely say that there can never be such
solution at all unless we approach it with
the effort to do fair and equal justice among
all men; and to demand from them in return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
just and fair treatment for others.
Our effort should be to secure to each man,
whatever his color, equality of opportunity,
equality of treatment before the law. As
a people striving to shape our actions in
accordance with the great law of righteousness
we can not afford to take part in or
be indifferent to the oppression or maltreatment
of any man who, against crushing
disadvantages, has by his own industry,
energy, self-respect, and perseverance
struggled upward to a position which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
would entitle him to the respect of his
fellows, if only his skin were of a different
hue. [Applause.]</p>

<p>Every generous impulse in us revolts
at the thought of thrusting down instead
of helping up such a man. To deny any
man the fair treatment granted to others
no better than he is to commit a wrong
upon him—a wrong sure to react in the
long run upon those guilty of such denial.
The only safe principle upon which Americans
can act is that of “all men up,” not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
that of “some men down.” [Applause.]
If in any community the level of intelligence,
morality, and thrift among the
colored men can be raised, it is, humanly
speaking, sure that the same level among
the whites will be raised to an even higher
degree; and it is no less sure that the
debasement of the blacks will in the end
carry with it an attendant debasement of
the whites. [Applause.]</p>

<p>The problem is so to adjust the relations
between two races of different ethnic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
type that the rights of neither be abridged
nor jeoparded; that the backward race
be trained so that it may enter into the
possession of true freedom, while the
forward race is enabled to preserve unharmed
the high civilization wrought out
by its forefathers. The working out of
this problem must necessarily be slow;
it is not possible in offhand fashion to
obtain or to confer the priceless boons of
freedom, industrial efficiency, political
capacity, and domestic morality. Nor is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
it only necessary to train the colored man;
it is quite as necessary to train the white
man, for on his shoulders rests a well-nigh
unparalleled sociological responsibility.
It is a problem demanding the
best thought, the utmost patience, the
most earnest effort, the broadest charity,
of the statesman, the student, the philanthropist;
of the leaders of thought in
every department of our national life.
The church can be a most important
factor in solving it aright. But above all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
else we need for its successful solution
the sober, kindly, steadfast, unselfish performance
of duty by the average plain
citizen in his everyday dealings with his
fellows. [Applause.]</p>

<p>The ideal of elemental justice meted
out to every man is the ideal we should
keep ever before us. It will be many
a long day before we attain to it, and
unless we show not only devotion to it,
but also wisdom and self-restraint in the
exhibition of that devotion, we shall defer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the time for its realization still further.
In striving to attain to so much of it as
concerns dealing with men of different
colors, we must remember two things.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is true of the colored
man, as it is true of the white man,
that in the long run his fate must depend
far more upon his own effort than upon the
efforts of any outside friend. [Applause.]
Every vicious, venal, or ignorant colored
man is an even greater foe to his own
race than to the community as a whole.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
[Applause.] The colored man’s self-respect
entitles him to do that share in the
political work of the country which is
warranted by his individual ability and
integrity and the position he has won for
himself. But the prime requisite of the
race is moral and industrial uplifting.</p>

<p>Laziness and shiftlessness, these, and
above all, vice and criminality of every
kind, are evils more potent for harm to
the black race than all acts of oppression
of white men put together. The colored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
man who fails to condemn crime in another
colored man, who fails to cooperate in all
lawful ways in bringing colored criminals
to justice, is the worst enemy of his own
people, as well as an enemy to all the
people. Law-abiding black men should,
for the sake of their race, be foremost in
relentless and unceasing warfare against
law-breaking black men. If the standards
of private morality and industrial efficiency
can be raised high enough among the
black race, then its future on this continent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
is secure. The stability and purity
of the home is vital to the welfare of the
black race, as it is to the welfare of every
race.</p>

<p>In the next place the white man, who,
if only he is willing, can help the colored
man more than all other white men put
together, is the white man who is his neighbor,
North or South. Each of us must do
his whole duty without flinching, and if
that duty is national it must be done in
accordance with the principles above laid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
down. But in endeavoring each to be his
brother’s keeper it is wise to remember
that each can normally do most for the
brother who is his immediate neighbor.
If we are sincere friends of the negro let
us each in his own locality show it by his
action therein, and let us each show it also
by upholding the hands of the white man,
in whatever locality, who is striving to do
justice to the poor and the helpless, to be
a shield to those whose need for such a
shield is great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>The heartiest acknowledgments are
due to the ministers, the judges and law
officers, the grand juries, the public men,
and the great daily newspapers in the
South, who have recently done such effective
work in leading the crusade against
lynching in the South; and I am glad to
say that during the last three months the
returns, as far as they can be gathered,
show a smaller number of lynchings than
for any other three months during the last
twenty years. Let us uphold in every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
way the hands of the men who have led
in this work, who are striving to do all
their work in this spirit. I am about to
quote from the address of the Right Reverend
Robert Strange, Bishop Coadjutor
of North Carolina, as given in the Southern
Churchman of October 8, 1904:</p>

<p>The Bishop first enters an emphatic
plea against any social intermingling of
the races; a question which must, of
course, be left to the people of each community
to settle for themselves, as in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
such a matter no one community—and
indeed no one individual—can dictate to
any other; always provided that in each
locality men keep in mind the fact
that there must be no confusing of
civil privileges with social intercourse.
[Applause.] Civil law can not regulate
social practices. Society, as such, is a law
unto itself, and will always regulate its own
practices and habits. Full recognition of
the fundamental fact that all men should
stand on an equal footing, as regards civil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
privileges, in no way interferes with recognition
of the further fact that all reflecting
men of both races are united in feeling
that race purity must be maintained.
The Bishop continues:</p>

<p>“What should the white men of the
South do for the negro? They must give
him a free hand, a fair field, and a cordial
godspeed, the two races working together
for their mutual benefit and for the development
of our common country. He
must have liberty, equal opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
make his living, to earn his bread, to
build his home. He must have justice,
equal rights, and protection before the law.
He must have the same political privileges;
the suffrage should be based on
character and intelligence for white and
black alike. He must have the same
public advantages of education; the public
schools are for all the people, whatever
their color or condition. The white
men of the South should give hearty and
respectful consideration to the exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
men of the negro race, to those who have
the character, the ability and the desire to
be lawyers, physicians, teachers, preachers,
leaders of thought and conduct
among their own men and women. We
should give them cheer and opportunity
to gratify every laudable ambition, and to
seek every innocent satisfaction among
their own people. Finally, the best white
men of the South should have frequent
conferences with the best colored men,
where, in frank, earnest, and sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
discussion they might understand each
other better, smooth difficulties, and so
guide and encourage the weaker race.”</p>

<p>Surely we can all of us join in expressing
our substantial agreement with the
principles thus laid down by this North
Carolina bishop, this representative of the
Christian thought of the South. [Applause.]</p>

<p>I am speaking on the occasion of the
celebration of the birthday of Abraham
Lincoln, and to men who count it their
peculiar privilege that they have the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
to hold Lincoln’s memory dear, and the
duty to strive to work along the lines that
he laid down. We can pay most fitting
homage to his memory by doing the
tasks allotted to us in the spirit in which
he did the infinitely greater and more
terrible tasks allotted to him.</p>

<p>Let us be steadfast for the right; but
let us err on the side of generosity rather
than on the side of vindictiveness toward
those who differ from us as to the method
of attaining the right. Let us never forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
our duty to help in uplifting the lowly,
to shield from wrong the humble; and let
us likewise act in a spirit of the broadest
and frankest generosity toward all our
brothers, all our fellow-countrymen; in a
spirit proceeding not from weakness but
from strength, a spirit which takes no more
account of locality than it does of class or
of creed; a spirit which is resolutely bent
on seeing that the Union which Washington
founded and which Lincoln saved
from destruction shall grow nobler and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
greater throughout the ages. [Cheers
and applause.]</p>

<p>I believe in this country with all my
heart and soul. I believe that our people
will in the end rise level to every
need, will in the end triumph over every
difficulty that rises before them. I could
not have such confident faith in the destiny
of this mighty people if I had it
merely as regards one portion of that
people. [Applause.] Throughout our
land things on the whole have grown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
better and not worse, and this is as true of
one part of the country as it is of another.
I believe in the southerner as I believe in
the northerner. I claim the right to feel
pride in his great qualities and in his great
deeds exactly as I feel pride in the great
qualities and deeds of every other American.
[Applause.] For weal or for woe
we are knit together, and we shall go up
or go down together; and I believe that
we shall go up and not down, that we shall
go forward instead of halting and falling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
back, because I have an abiding faith in
the generosity, the courage, the resolution,
and the common sense of all my countrymen.
[Applause.]</p>

<p>The Southern States face difficult
problems; and so do the Northern States.
Some of the problems are the same for
the entire country. Others exist in
greater intensity in one section; and yet
others exist in greater intensity in another
section. But in the end they will all
be solved; for fundamentally our people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
are the same throughout this land; the
same in the qualities of heart and brain
and hand which have made this Republic
what it is in the great to-day; which will
make it what it is to be in the infinitely
greater to-morrow. [Applause.] I admire
and respect and believe in and have faith
in the men and women of the South as I
admire and respect and believe in and

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
